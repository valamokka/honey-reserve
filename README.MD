# **Honey Reserve**


This project is a simple application to register products (honey, in this case) in a database, and follow up on the summary of the income after
a market day is finished.

There are 3 options:

**Setup menu:** the user is able to register, delete or edit the data of the products.

**Pack/Sell menu:** on this page, the user can set which kind of, and how many products they packed ready for the next market day

**Market results menu:** this page is to summarize the income, and also it calculates the shares of the income according to the rules 
                         set as the user wishes. First we need to write in how many products remained unsell, than one click and the 
                         results are shown on the screen. For example, in this case my and my father's share are displayed.
                         Also there is an export ability, which creates a simple document with the list of the sold honeys.

this is a prototype version. it works, but I am continously working on making it better.
